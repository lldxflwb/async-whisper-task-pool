# Gemini CLI Agent Interaction Summary

## Date: 2025年7月10日星期四

## Project Overview:
This project is an asynchronous speech-to-text service based on Whisper, comprising both client and server components.
*   **Client:** Responsible for scanning video files, converting them to audio, encrypting and packaging them, uploading them to the server, and then polling for transcription results to save SRT subtitle files.
*   **Server:** Provides API interfaces to receive tasks, manage task queues, and utilize the `whisper` command-line tool to perform the actual speech-to-text transcription. The project also includes a separate `script` directory for post-processing generated SRT files to clean up repetitive content.

## Recent Modification: Real-time Whisper Output

**Description:**
Implemented real-time output of Whisper transcription progress in the server logs. This modification enhances visibility into the transcription process, allowing for better monitoring of task progress.

**Changes Made:**
1.  **File Modified:** `server/whisper_worker.py`
2.  **Specific Changes:**
    *   Removed the `--verbose 'False'` argument from the `whisper` command call to allow its default output behavior.
    *   Modified the subprocess output capture logic within the `_run_whisper` function. Instead of waiting for the process to complete and then reading `stdout` and `stderr` in one go, the `stderr` stream is now asynchronously read line by line. Each line is then logged using `logger.info`, providing real-time updates on the transcription progress.

**Rationale:**
The user requested real-time feedback on the Whisper transcription process to monitor progress more effectively. By streaming the `stderr` output of the `whisper` command directly to the server logs, the system now provides immediate visibility into the ongoing transcription.

**Verification (Conceptual):**
The changes were verified conceptually for correctness in terms of Python `asyncio` subprocess handling and logging. Actual runtime verification would require deployment to a GPU server, which is outside the scope of this local interaction.
